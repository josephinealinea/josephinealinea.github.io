          <p>Filipino - Software Engineer currently living in Singapore.</p>
          <p>
            I started my working career in an Australian IT solution firm in the Philippines. 
            We specilized in banking-solution applications and that's where I was introduced to the banking industry.
            My first programming language that I have used at work is called Smalltalk. It's a very old language and I wonder who else know this.
            I then studied Java as we started using this to build web applications.
          </p>
          <p>After three years of working there, I flew and accepted a job in Singapore. It's a French corporate bank and I was assigned to work on the core banking systems of the bank.
            I was there for a long time and I got the opportunity to see and experienced how the application and software development evolved. 
            Back then,  we used company owned legacy framework, which was very difficult to debug, and make modifications. (Not to mention the framework was created by non English developers). 
            We then started using open-sourced libraries such as Spring and Springboot, Angular JS. Learning a new tech stack was quite exciting especially when you know you have a community support online.
            We also work using Microservice architecture. I learned a lot in that transition, we used new frameworks and varieties of tools such as Camel, RabbitMQ, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Consul, Freemarker, Cucumber, Citrus.
            We also migrated our applications into Cloud and use Docker and Kubernetes.
          </p>
          <p>Now, I am currently working in a Telco industry company. The industry is different from what I worked on before but it was really enjoying and exciting. 
            I am learning everyday and getting myself familiarize with the Network architecture, which I am also excited to write something about.</p>
