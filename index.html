          <p>Filipino - Software Engineer currently living in Singapore.</p>
          <p>
            I started my working career in an Australian IT solution firm in the Philippines.
            We specilized in banking-solution applications where I was introduced to the banking industry.
            The first programming language I used at work is called Smalltalk. It's an old, object-oriented language
            I've first learned professionally.
            I then studied Java as we started using this to build web applications.
          </p>
          <p>After three years of working there, I flew and accepted a job in Singapore. It's a French corporate bank
            and I was assigned to work on the core banking systems of the bank.
            I was there for a long time and I got the opportunity to see and experienced how the application and
            software development evolved.
            Back then, we used company owned legacy framework, which was very difficult to debug, and make
            modifications.
            We then started using open-sourced libraries such as Spring and Springboot, Angular JS. Learning a new tech
            stack was quite exciting especially when you know you have an community support.
            We transitioned from a monolithic application into Micro-services architecture. I learned a lot in that
            transition, we used new frameworks and varieties of tools such as Camel, RabbitMQ, Kafka, ElasticSearch,
            Consul, Freemarker, Cucumber, Citrus.
            We also migrated our applications into Cloud and use Docker and Kubernetes.
          </p>
          <p>Now, I currently work in a Telco industry company. The industry is different but it is still software
            development.
            I am learning everyday and getting myself familiarize with the Network infrastructure architecture, which I
            am also excited to write something about.</p>
