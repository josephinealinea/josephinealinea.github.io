## Biography

# TLDR; (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
From Manila’s 🇵🇭 hustle to Singapore’s 🇸🇬 skyline to Tallinn’s 🇪🇪 tech scene — I build, automate, and deliver production-grade software that works. Experienced across FinTech 📈, Banking 🏦, Telco 📡, and iGaming 🎲, I bring cross-functional skills from analysis to development to modern day delivery.

Hey there!
Thanks for stopping by — I’m guessing you want to know a little about me. 😊

I started my career in Manila, Philippines (yes, I’m Filipina 🇵🇭). I was part of a team building loan application systems for financial institutions in Australia and the UK. We used Smalltalk language (which is for those who doesn't know, was the first Object-Oriented Programming language started by Alan Kay, the father of OOP).

As a Junior Programmer, I didn’t just learn how to code — I learned how to think critically. We were expected to understand the functional requirements behind every project: What are we building? Why does it matter? Who will use it? I was lucky to have incredible mentors, especially my first one, who shaped the way I work to this day.

While enjoying my time there (and the occasional visits to the UK and Australia offices), an unexpected opportunity led me to Singapore 🇸🇬.

My first role there was at a French corporate bank, building various in-house banking solutions. This was where I evolved from being “just” a developer to becoming more of a backend engineer — and discovered that’s where my heart lies. Frontend work is rewarding (you see results instantly), but backend engineering satisfies the perfectionist in me. I loved writing tests, automating processes, deploying code anywhere, and getting consistent results every time.

Over time, I wore many hats — from operations and development to starting projects from scratch, running proof-of-concepts, and leading as a Technical Lead. My team and I transformed monoliths into microservices, containerized applications, moved workloads to the cloud, and explored diverse tech stacks. It was an exciting, transformative chapter.

Eventually, I moved to Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), Asia’s largest telco. In the Network department, I helped orchestrate products and use cases for 5G technology — work that felt like helping modernize the world. This was also when I dipped deeper into DevOps, expanding beyond pure coding into infrastructure, automation, and systems thinking.

Life then took me north — to Tallinn, Estonia 🇪🇪 — where I joined a US-based casino games company in the iGaming division. Being new to the industry took me back to my teenage years, when I was obsessed with video games 🎮. I’d play adventure and role-playing games for hours without sleep, completely immersed in those worlds. Back then, I dreamed of building games. Now, I’m actually doing it — and that’s a dream come true. I’m excited and hungry to keep learning, building, and exploring what’s next.
